# Code Quality Reflection

## Introduction

This document serves as a reflection on the code quality of my project, assessing it based on the principles and practices discussed in chapters 2-11 of "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin, as well as insights gained from lectures and workshops. The goal is to evaluate how these principles have been applied or could be better applied in my codebase to ensure that it adheres to high standards of clarity, maintainability, and robustness.

## Chapter 2: Meaningful Names

**Reflection:**

The methods validateAndSetEventDataForTitle, validateAndSetEventDataForGraphType, and validateAndSetEventDataForData exhibit a commendable adherence to the principles laid out in Chapter 2 of "Clean Code," specifically regarding the use of meaningful and intention-revealing names. The intent behind each method is clear and unambiguous, thanks to the descriptive and precise naming convention adopted. For instance, validateAndSetEventDataForTitle unambiguously conveys its dual responsibility of validation and data setting pertaining to a graph's title. 

In conclusion, the methods reflect a strong understanding of the principles outlined in Chapter 2 of "Clean Code," demonstrating a commitment to writing clear and expressive code.

## Chapter 3: Functions

**Reflection:**

Chapter 3 of "Clean Code" emphasizes the importance of creating small, focused functions that do one thing and do it well. Reflecting on the `setupTypeForm`, `setupTitleForm`, and `setupDataForm` methods in light of these principles reveals both strengths and areas for improvement.

Each function has a clear and singular purpose, aligning well with the “Do One Thing” principle. `setupTypeForm` creates the form for choosing the graph type, `setupTitleForm` sets up the form for entering the graph title, and `setupDataForm` prepares the form for entering graph data. The functions are relatively small, and the code within them is straightforward, enhancing readability.

In summary chapter 3 have tought me that functions should be small and focused on the problem domain.

## Chapter 4: Comments

**Reflection:**

Chapter 4 of "Clean Code" discusses the use of comments in a codebase, stating that comments should be used sparingly and that the need for comments can often be reduced by writing clear and expressive code. Reflecting on the downloadGraph method in this context provides insights into the application of these principles.

In the provided code, there are no comments present. This aligns with the book’s philosophy that code should be self-explanatory and that the need for comments can often be eliminated by writing clear code. The method name downloadGraph is descriptive, and the code within the method is straightforward and easy to follow. This makes the purpose and functionality of the method clear without the need for additional comments.

Initially, I held a positive view on the use of comments, seeing them as crucial for elucidating the problem domain and maintaining code readability. However, my perspective shifted after participating in the workshop focused on LLM-generated code. I began to question the indispensability of comments, leaning instead towards the "Clean Code" philosophy that advocates for self-explanatory code. I now understand that the art of writing clear and expressive code can significantly reduce the reliance on comments, preventing code pollution and fostering a cleaner, more maintainable codebase. This paradigm shift has been a valuable learning experience, highlighting the importance of code clarity and expressiveness.

## Chapter 5: Formatting

**Reflection:**

Reflecting on the formatting of this particular code snippet, I appreciate the consistency in style, which aligns with the principles from Chapter 5 of "Clean Code." The uniform use of single quotes and indentation makes the code easy to read and understand, reflecting a disciplined approach to coding.

I’ve structured the methods to have a single responsibility and maintained alignment within the code, which adds to its visual clarity.

I have ensured consistent formatting across various setups by providing a Prettier lint config and a script for all maintainers. This proactive step aligns with the clean code philosophy and contributes significantly to maintaining a uniform style, which I believe is crucial for the long-term maintainability and readability of the codebase.

## Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures

**Reflection:**

In aligning the GraphContainer component with the practices suggested in Chapter 6 of "Clean Code," the component exemplifies cohesive structure and clear separation of concerns. Its role as an orchestrator for child components promotes a modular design, adhering to the principle of small, focused classes.

The event-driven interactions between the GraphContainer and its child components showcase a commendable effort to reduce coupling, fostering a maintainable codebase. This encapsulates the internal workings of each component, exposing only the necessary parts and aligning with the book’s emphasis on abstract data types.

## Chapter 7: Error Handling

**Reflection:**

The GraphRenderer component's approach to error handling is reflective of the principles in Chapter 7 of "Clean Code." The use of try-catch blocks encapsulates error handling, keeping the main logic clean and focused. Methods like connectedCallback, downloadGraph, and initChart demonstrate handling errors at a high level, aligning with the guideline to separate concerns. The renderError function is a good embodiment of a single-responsibility principle, focusing solely on error presentation. However, there's room to enhance the code by reducing repetitive error-handling patterns and introducing more specific error types. This reflection encourages a review of the code to ensure adherence to these clean code principles, enhancing robustness and maintainability.

## Chapter 8: Boundaries

**Reflection:**

The rules about boundaries from Chapter 8 of "Clean Code" are reflected in the GraphRenderer component. The component serves as a boundary object, encapsulating the complexity and specifics of the 'testgraphifyjs' library, thereby ensuring that the rest of the application remains decoupled from this external dependency.

The good practices observed include encapsulation of the external library within the initChart method, where the MyChart class from 'testgraphifyjs' is instantiated and configured. This encapsulation helps in creating a clear and stable interface, as suggested in "Clean Code", minimizing the impact of any potential changes in the 'testgraphifyjs' library on the rest of the codebase.

## Chapter 9: Unit Tests

**Reflection:**

When I haven't focused on implementing unit testing in this project, I have done so in my module. I tried to rigorously test the `MyChart` class, ensuring that it correctly initializes the appropriate chart type based on the provided configuration. Using Jest as my testing framework, I wrote tests to verify that a `BarChart` instance is created when the configuration specifies a bar chart, and similarly, a `PieChart` instance is created for a pie chart configuration. This is achieved by mocking the `BarChart` and `PieChart` classes, isolating the tests to the `MyChart` class functionality. This approach ensures the integrity of the chart initialization process in the module, aligning with best practices.

My reflection is that unit testing is a valuable practice that can significantly enhance the quality and the time spent on a codebase. I intend to apply this practice more consistently in my future projects, ensuring that the code is robust and maintainable.

**Examples from Code:**
```
import MyChart from '../../src/module/main/MyChart.js'
import { BarChart } from '../../src/module/charts/BarChart.js'
import { PieChart } from '../../src/module/charts/PieChart.js'

jest.mock('../../src/module/charts/BarChart.js')
jest.mock('../../src/module/charts/PieChart.js')

describe('MyChart', () => {
  let ctxMock

  beforeEach(() => {
    // Creating a mock for the canvas rendering context
    ctxMock = {
      fillText: jest.fn(),
      moveTo: jest.fn(),
      lineTo: jest.fn(),
      stroke: jest.fn(),
      fill: jest.fn(),
      beginPath: jest.fn(),
      closePath: jest.fn()
    }

    BarChart.mockClear()
    PieChart.mockClear()
  })

  it('should create a BarChart instance for type "bar"', () => {
    const config = {
      type: 'bar',
      data: [10, 50, 100],
      color: 'purple',
      labels: ['A', 'B', 'C']
    }

    const myChart = new MyChart(ctxMock, config)
    const chartInstance = myChart.init()

    expect(BarChart).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
    expect(PieChart).not.toHaveBeenCalled()
    expect(chartInstance).toBeInstanceOf(BarChart)
  })

  it('should create a PieChart instance for type "pie"', () => {
    const config = {
      type: 'pie',
      data: [50, 100, 150],
      labels: ['A', 'B', 'C'],
      colors: ['#FF5733', '#33FF57', '#5733FF']
    }

    const myChart = new MyChart(ctxMock, config)
    const chartInstance = myChart.init()

    expect(PieChart).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
    expect(BarChart).not.toHaveBeenCalled()
    expect(chartInstance).toBeInstanceOf(PieChart)
  })
})

```

## Chapter 10: Classes

**Reflection:**

In designing the `custom-button` component, I applied principles from Chapter 10 of "Clean Code" to ensure clarity and maintainability. The component strictly adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle, focusing solely on button functionalities and rendering. Utilization of Shadow DOM and private methods guarantees encapsulation, safeguarding internal mechanics and styling. This approach aligns with the chapter's emphasis on class organization and encapsulation, promoting a clear and simple interface. The component remains concise, avoiding the complexity of oversized classes and numerous methods. Overall, this design ensures that the `custom-button` component is easily understandable, maintainable, and extendable. This reflection encapsulates my commitment to writing clean, efficient, and purposeful code, following the guidelines of Chapter 10.

## Chapter 11: Systems

**Reflection:**

Building this app upon Custom Web Components using the Shadow DOM this has provided valuable insights into the principles from Chapter 11 of "Clean Code." The use of Web Components has enabled a modular design, promoting a clear separation of concerns and a simple interface. The components are decoupled, allowing for independent development and maintenance. This aligns with the chapter's emphasis on system organization and the Single Responsibility Principle. The use of Shadow DOM and private methods ensures encapsulation, safeguarding internal mechanics and styling.

However in terms of the chapter Systems the app architecture is not on that abstraction level. The app is not a system, but a collection of components, where one component in this case `graph-container` is the orchestrator. The `graph-container` component is responsible for the communication between the other components.
